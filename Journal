  Regie working on creating AWS account.
  Me and Ted emailed Dspace and Islondra respectively to gather more information on the system. Below is the email that we sent to the support group
  
  My name is Theodore Ryan and member of team of students from Saint Martin's University that is working on senior project that is doing a product comparison for a report for our school library to build a repository.
  Some question are:

  What is the size of resources to maintain sand operate a Islandora system? Server space/ software/
 What is the overall cost? Monthly? or yearly?
 Security issues that need to be addressed?
 Does it need separate user inaction system?

  These just dome that I am looking at. IF there is way to do a phone meeting would be great for my team.

Any help would be greatly appreciated. You can contact me Tryan@stmartin.edu or 253-677-9665(cell). CC is our team leader Raj Bhetwal.

Thank you for your time
Respectfully
